# C-Code
This repository is for all of my programming labs and assignments during my second year of Computer System Engineering at Carleton University!
The class where all of these projects were made was SYSC2006 Foundations of Imperative Programming.

## Labs
Starting off the first 13 projects are all labs that were used to teach me the basics of C Programming. The topics start with basic syntax, and
progress through to different data structures like linked lists, queues, and stacks.

## Assignment
### Text Based Facebook
This was the longest project I worked on in this class. It is a text based facebook program which uses the user inputs from the terminal to create
an account, manage the users password, the users posts, and the users friends. This is done by using three linked lists, one for the user, the
friends, and the posts of each user. 

There are two versions of this program, one of them was used as a bonus assignment. The first version does not require a login, names are not case sensitive, and the friends
are their own separate structure. These changes were made for the second version.
